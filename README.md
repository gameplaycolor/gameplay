Building
--------

Game Play is built using a custom Python build script which inlines and minifies HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and binds in the settings for a given deployment.

For example, building the release version of Game Play as hosted on [gameplaycolor.com](https://gameplaycolor.com) can be done by running the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
scripts/build build settings/release.json
```

The build will be created in the `build` directory, and a corresponding *.tar.gz will be creatd in `archives`, tagged with the git sha and settings name (e.g., `build-168bd9d0d8d309a1efb1983bd61ec34ff22951b5-release.tar.gz`).
